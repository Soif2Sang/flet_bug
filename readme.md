Once the application is started, you will see a list of 'Tiles' that contains few icons :
    - The first one is to open its logs
    - The others are to start/pause/stop tasks

The tasks are very minimal and only aims to create logs and timers.

1. Start all the tiles in order to start the tasks.
2. Open one (or more) logs by clicking on the gear
3. Wait until it freezes by itself

Please note that if you don't show the logs it won't freeze, also the more jobs we have and tighter the sleeps are the faster we get the freeze.
